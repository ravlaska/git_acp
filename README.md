# Git ACP [Add Commit Push]
Super simple script that speeds up committing to remote repos.

1. Download the script and place it in a permanent directory.
2. Run `./acp.sh --init`, to create alias to script.
3. There is an option to automatically save all the PAT tokens to encrypted database (locally).
4. Now just type 'acp' win any git directory to push it.

The script gives you also the possibility to easily create a new branch and push into it automatically.
